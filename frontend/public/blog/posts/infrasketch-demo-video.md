## What You'll See

The demo walks through the core InfraSketch workflow:

### 1. Describe Your System

Start by typing a natural language description of the system you want to design. For example:

> "Design a real-time analytics platform that handles 50,000 events per second with sub-second query latency"

No need to think about boxes and arrows yet - just describe what you need.

### 2. AI Generates the Architecture

InfraSketch's AI analyzes your requirements and generates a complete architecture including:

- **Components**: Databases, caches, load balancers, queues, and services
- **Data flows**: How information moves between components
- **Technology choices**: Specific tools like Kafka, Redis, PostgreSQL based on your requirements
- **Scalability considerations**: Built-in patterns for handling your specified load

### 3. Refine Through Conversation

The real power comes from iteration. Click on any component and ask questions like:

- "What happens if this service goes down?"
- "Can we add rate limiting here?"
- "Switch from PostgreSQL to MongoDB"

The AI understands context and makes surgical updates to your diagram.

### 4. Export Your Design

When you're satisfied, export your architecture as:

- **PNG** - High-resolution diagram image
- **PDF** - Full design document with component details
- **Markdown** - Documentation you can check into your repo

## Why This Matters

Traditional diagramming tools require you to think visually first. You have to know what components you need and manually place each one. InfraSketch flips this - describe the problem, and let AI handle the visual representation.

This is especially useful for:

- **System design interviews**: Quickly generate architectures to discuss trade-offs
- **Architecture proposals**: Create professional diagrams for stakeholder buy-in
- **Learning**: See how experienced architects would approach your problem
