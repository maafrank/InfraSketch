      BADGE VERIFICATION WORKAROUND
      =============================
      These hidden badges exist for verification bots from launch platforms (Product Hunt,
      LaunchIgniter, NextGen Tools, etc.) that cannot execute JavaScript.

      Problem: Our React SPA renders badges via JavaScript in LandingPage.jsx. Verification
      bots see only the empty <div id="root"></div> and fail to find the badges.

      Solution: Duplicate badges here in static HTML. They're hidden from users (display:none)
      but visible to bots that parse raw HTML.

      Note: We attempted Vite prerendering (vite-prerender-plugin) but React Router v7 removed
      the /server export needed for SSR, making it incompatible with current prerender plugins.

      When adding new badges:
      1. Add them to LandingPage.jsx (for users)
      2. Add them here (for bots)
      3. Update CSP in infrastructure/response-headers-policy.json if new domains needed
         (See CLAUDE.md "Updating CloudFront Security Headers" section)
