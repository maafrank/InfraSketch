## Slide 2: Problem

**Header:** The Problem

**Key Points:**
1. **System design is intimidating** - Engineers struggle to translate ideas into architecture
2. **Documentation is tedious** - Design docs take hours to write, often skipped entirely
3. **Vibe coding lacks structure** - AI can write code, but what code should be written?

**Statistic to find:**
- % of engineering time spent on documentation
- % of projects that lack proper architecture docs

**Visuals:**
- Split screen: messy whiteboard sketch vs. blank document
- Or: frustrated developer at whiteboard

---

## Slide 3: Solution

**Header:** InfraSketch: Think It, See It, Build It

**Key Points:**
1. **Describe your system in plain English** - "I need an e-commerce platform with user auth, product catalog, and payments"
2. **Get an interactive architecture diagram** - Nodes, connections, technologies, all editable
3. **Generate comprehensive design docs** - One click, full technical documentation

**Demo GIF/Video:**
- 10-second loop showing: prompt → diagram → design doc

**Visuals:**
- Screenshot of the app with a completed diagram

## Notes

### Key Narratives to Emphasize

1. **Vibe Coding Context** - Position as the "pre-cursor" to Cursor. Before you write code, you need to know what to build.

2. **Education Angle** - System design interviews are a massive pain point. InfraSketch makes learning interactive.

3. **Documentation Problem** - Nobody likes writing docs. AI solves this entirely.

4. **Developer-First** - Built by developers, for developers. Not enterprise-first bloatware.

### Investor Objections to Prepare For

| Objection | Response |
|-----------|----------|
| "Can't ChatGPT do this?" | Text-only, no visual output, no persistence, no editing |
| "What's the moat?" | Agent architecture, tool-based reliability, domain-specific training |
| "Is this a feature or a product?" | End-to-end workflow (diagram → docs → export) is the product |
| "How do you acquire users?" | Education content, free tier virality, developer communities |
| "Why solo founder?" | Built entire stack myself, raising to accelerate growth not to build product |
| "Is $1M too much for this stage?" | 75% activation rate + working billing = de-risked, need runway for growth experiments |
