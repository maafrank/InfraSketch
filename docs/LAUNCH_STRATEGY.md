# InfraSketch Launch Strategy

This document outlines strategies for launching InfraSketch, gathering user feedback, and making initial monetization decisions.

## User Feedback Collection

### 1. In-App Feedback Widget (RECOMMENDED - Best ROI)

**Implementation:**
- Add a floating "Feedback" button in bottom-right corner
- Opens a simple form: "What do you think?" + optional email field
- Sends feedback to email or stores in backend

**Tools:**
- **Tally.so** - Free forms, easily embeddable
- **Typeform** - Better UI, nicer experience
- **Simple mailto link** - `mailto:your@email.com?subject=InfraSketch Feedback`

**Why this first:** Captures feedback from people already using your product.

### 2. Product Hunt Launch

**What it is:**
- Daily ranking of new products
- Tech-savvy audience
- Can get 500-5000 views on launch day
- Users leave comments/feedback directly

**Best practices:**
- Launch Tuesday-Thursday for best visibility
- Prepare screenshots, demo video, and compelling description
- Be active in comments section
- Ask friends to upvote early (first hour matters)

### 3. Reddit Posts

**Target subreddits:**
- r/webdev - Web developers
- r/selfhosted - Self-hosting enthusiasts
- r/SaaS - SaaS builders
- r/SideProject - Side project community
- r/aws - AWS users
- r/devops - DevOps engineers

**Post format:**
```
Title: "I built an AI tool to generate system architecture diagrams"

Body:
- What problem it solves
- Link to live demo
- Screenshot/GIF
- Explicitly ask: "What features would you want?"
```

**Tips:**
- Be genuine, not promotional
- Respond to all comments
- Post in relevant communities only
- Don't spam multiple subs same day

### 4. Hacker News (Show HN)

**Format:**
- Title: "Show HN: InfraSketch - AI-powered system design tool"
- Submit your live URL
- Comment with additional context

**Timing:**
- Post between 8-10am EST for best visibility
- Can get thousands of views if it trends
- Expect honest, direct (sometimes harsh) feedback

### 5. Add Analytics (Understand User Behavior)

**Privacy-friendly options:**

1. **Plausible Analytics** (RECOMMENDED)
   - Simple, privacy-focused
   - GDPR compliant (no cookie banner needed)
   - Shows: page views, unique visitors, bounce rate
   - Cost: ~$9/month

2. **PostHog**
   - Free tier available
   - Session recordings (see exactly what users do)
   - Feature flags
   - More complex setup

3. **Google Analytics**
   - Free, most powerful
   - Privacy concerns (requires cookie consent)
   - Steeper learning curve

**What to track:**
- Number of diagrams generated
- Average session length
- Which features used most
- Drop-off points (where users leave)
- Export button clicks
- Chat interactions

### 6. Direct Outreach

**Personal network:**
- Share with friends/colleagues in tech
- Post in Slack/Discord communities you're in
- LinkedIn post with demo video
- Twitter/X thread with screenshots

**Ask specific questions:**
- "What would make this more useful for you?"
- "What's confusing about the interface?"
- "Would you pay for this? How much?"

### 7. Exit Survey

**Implementation:**
- When users close tab or click "New Design"
- Show quick popup: "Before you go, what would make this more useful?"
- Single question + optional email
- Store responses

**Why:** Captures feedback from people who tried it but didn't find it useful (most valuable feedback).

## Monetization Strategy

### Current State: Free, No Ads

**Recommendation: Keep it this way for now.**

### Why NOT to Add Google AdSense (Yet)

**Your concerns are valid:**
1. **Safety:** AdSense is safe - just browser JavaScript, won't affect backend
2. **Cost:** AdSense PAYS you (no cost), but earnings are very low
3. **Ad content:** You have limited control - could show irrelevant ads

**Reasons to wait:**
1. **Poor UX** - Ads clutter interface, distract from tool
2. **Low revenue** - Need 10K+ monthly users to make meaningful money (expect $5-50/month with low traffic)
3. **Professional appearance** - Ad-free looks more credible
4. **Better alternatives exist** (see below)

**If you still want ads:** Wait until 500+ daily active users minimum.

### Better Monetization Options

#### Option 1: Freemium Model (RECOMMENDED)
```
Free Tier:
- 5 diagrams per month
- Basic features
- No account required

Pro Tier ($9/month):
- Unlimited diagrams
- Save diagrams to account
- Export to PDF/PNG/Markdown
- Priority support
- Version history
```

#### Option 2: Usage-Based Pricing
- Pay per diagram generated
- $0.50 per diagram
- Buy credits in bulk (10 for $4, 50 for $15)

#### Option 3: Enterprise/Team Plans
- $49/month for teams
- Shared workspaces
- Collaboration features
- SSO integration
- Priority support

#### Option 4: API Access
- Developers pay to use your API
- $0.10 per API call
- B2B revenue stream

### Monetization Timeline

**Phase 1 (Weeks 1-4): Validate Product**
- Keep completely free
- Focus on user feedback
- Improve core features
- Build user base

**Phase 2 (Month 2-3): Add User Accounts (Optional)**
- Simple email signup
- Save diagrams feature
- Track usage patterns
- See what power users do

**Phase 3 (Month 3-6): Introduce Paid Tier**
- Only if you have consistent usage (100+ weekly active users)
- Start with freemium model
- Keep generous free tier
- Monitor conversion rate (aim for 2-5%)

**Phase 4 (Month 6+): Optimize Pricing**
- A/B test pricing
- Add team features
- Consider enterprise sales

## User Profiles: Should You Add Them?

### Current State
- Sessions are temporary/in-memory
- No persistence across browser sessions
- No login required (frictionless)
- Simple architecture

### Pros of Adding User Profiles
1. **Save diagrams permanently** - Users can access work later
2. **Version history** - Track changes to designs
3. **Sharing** - Share diagrams via links
4. **Usage tracking** - Understand power users
5. **Monetization enabler** - Free tier vs paid unlimited
6. **Email collection** - Build user base for marketing

### Cons of Adding User Profiles
1. **Complexity** - Need database, auth, session management
2. **Development time** - 1-2 weeks to build properly
3. **Costs** - Database hosting (DynamoDB ~$5-20/month)
4. **Privacy concerns** - Need terms of service, privacy policy
5. **Friction** - Some users bounce at signup

### Recommended Approach: Phased Implementation

**Phase 1 (Now): Keep it simple**
- Anonymous sessions (current state)
- Focus on core product quality
- Get user feedback
- Validate problem/solution fit

**Phase 2 (After validation): Add optional accounts**
- "Save this diagram?" prompt with email signup
- Store diagrams in DynamoDB
- Simple magic-link auth (no passwords)
- Keep anonymous mode available

**Phase 3 (Growth): Full user system**
- Dashboard with all saved diagrams
- Sharing/collaboration features
- Team workspaces
- Usage tiers (free/paid)

### Quick Implementation (If You Decide to Add Users)

**Tech stack:**
- **Auth:** Clerk or Auth0 (handles UI, security, sessions)
- **Database:** DynamoDB (serverless, cheap, scales automatically)
- **Storage schema:** `user_id -> [diagram_1, diagram_2, ...]`

**Keep current flow:** Anonymous users can still use without signup.

### Alternative: Hybrid Approach (No Backend Changes)

**Features:**
- "Export diagram" saves as `.json` file
- "Import diagram" loads from `.json` file
- Users manage persistence locally
- No database needed
- Still provides value

**Implementation:** 2-3 hours of work.

## Decision Framework

### When to Add User Accounts

**Add them if:**
- ✅ Users explicitly ask "How do I save this?"
- ✅ You see repeat visitors (check analytics)
- ✅ Average session length > 5 minutes
- ✅ People are exporting diagrams
- ✅ You're ready to monetize

**Don't add if:**
- ❌ Most users are one-and-done
- ❌ No one asks about saving
- ❌ You're still iterating on core features
- ❌ Low traffic (< 50 users/week)

### When to Add Monetization

**You're ready if:**
- ✅ 100+ weekly active users
- ✅ Strong retention (30%+ come back)
- ✅ Positive user feedback
- ✅ Clear value proposition
- ✅ Core features are solid

**Not ready if:**
- ❌ Still fixing bugs
- ❌ Low traffic (< 50 weekly users)
- ❌ High bounce rate (> 80%)
- ❌ No validation yet

**Remember:** Focus on getting users and feedback FIRST, monetize LATER. Most products fail because they don't solve a real problem, not because they don't monetize early enough.
